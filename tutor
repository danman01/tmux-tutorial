     Tmux is a very powerful console multiplexor that has many commands, too many to explain in a tutor such as this.  This tutor is designed to describe
     enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use Tmux as
     an all-purpose development environment.

     The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 25-30 minutes,
     depending upon how much time is spent with experimentation.

     ATTENTION:
     The commands in the lessons will modify the text.  Make a copy of this
     file to practise on (if you started "tmuxtutor" this is already a copy).

     It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by
     use.  That means that you need to execute the commands to learn them
     properly.  If you only read the text, you will forget the commands!

     Now, make sure that your Shift-Lock key is NOT depressed and press
     the   j   key enough times to move the cursor so that Lesson 1.1
     completely fills the screen.

			Lesson 1.1:  Starting tmux


     1. In a new terminal window, start a new tmux session with a session name: tmux new -s myname

     2. see the session you just created by listing sessions: tmux ls

     3. Once tmux has started, move to Lesson 1.2.

    Lesson 1.2: Detach and Attach from a session

    1. The prefix keystroke is used to execute many tmux commands. By default, Ctrl-b is your tmux prefix.

    2. Type Prefix - d to detach from the current session

    3. Type tmux ls to view all running sessions, and you should see your session you started in lesson 1.1

    4. Type tmux at -t myname to attach to your named session

    5. To kill a session, type tmux kill-session -t myname. You will not be able to reattach once the session is killed.
